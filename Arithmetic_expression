#Write a python script to read a number from the user,
#find the difference between the sum of squares up to that number and the number itself. 

#Input:

#Number

#Output:

#Difference between the sum of squares up to that number and itself. 

#For example if a number is 3, then output will be 11 ( i.e 1 2 + 2 2 + 3 2   - 3 = 11)

#CODE

n=int(input('enter the number'))
sum1=0
for i in range(1,n+1):
    sq=i**2
    sum1=sum1+sq
o=sum1-n
print(o)
