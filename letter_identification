#Given three words, write an algorithm and the subsequent Python code to
#identify the following letters:

#Letters common to all the three words
#Letters in first two words but not in third word
#Letters in first word but not in second and third word
#Letters in all the three words
#For example, if the words are apple, camel, element then letters in common to
#all the three words -  i, e

#Letters in first two words but not in third word – a

#Letters in first word but not in second and third word  - p

#Letters in all the three words – a, p, p, l, e, c, m, n, t
