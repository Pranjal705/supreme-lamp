#Arrangement of Plants
#A gardener has the practice of assigning ID to the plants during plantation.
#One day, he makes a note of the heights of plants in his garden.
#He writes the height of the plant against the ID of the plant.
#He then instructs his employee to keep the plants, in ascending order of
#its height. Design an algorithm and write the Python code to display the list
#of ID numbers of plants in ascending order of their height.
#IDs are also numbers. Check for boundary conditions and print 'Invalid input'
#for wrong input. For example, if there are three trees with IDs as
#175, 160, 120 and height as 47, 73 and 23 then the output should be
#[120, 175, 160].
