#Creating Unique List and Searching
#A login register is maintained in a library in which,
#the register number of students are recorded when they enter the library. Sometimes it happens that the students
#visit the library more than once in a day and hence duplicate entries occur so frequently in the register.
#The librarian wants to have a report of all students who have visited on a particular day, ‘x’.
#Given the list  of students who visited the library on the day ‘x’, write an algorithm and the subsequent Python program
#to prepare a report with unique register number of students. Also read a register number ‘r’ and search for it in the list.
#Print ‘Found’ if ‘r’ is in the list and print ‘Not found’ otherwise.
n=int(input('enter the no. students visited'))
e=[]
for i in range(0,n):
    r=input()
    e.append(r)
list1=list(dict.fromkeys(e))
print(list1)
    
s=input()
if s in e:
    print('Found')
else:
    print('Not found')
